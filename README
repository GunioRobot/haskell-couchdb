CouchDB 0.8.0
-------------

This release is for CouchDB 0.8.0.


HTTP-3001.0.4
-------------

The HTTP-3001.0.4 library suffers from a memory leak.  It doesn't close sockets,
so after opening and closing many connections, your application will have "too
many open files."

This bug can affect any long-running application that uses the CouchDB library.
Until this library is updated, you will have to patch it yourself.   Potential
fixes were discussed in this thread on Haskell Cafe:
